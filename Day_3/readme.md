# Day 2 (Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP))

This whitepaper explores context engineering as the practice of dynamically assembling and managing information within an agent's context window to create stateful and personalized Al experiences. It defines Sessions as the container for a single, immediate conversation's history, and Memory as the long-term persistence mechanism.

In the codelabs, you will learn how to make agents stateful by managing conversation history through context engineering in ADK, and working memory within a session, allowing your agent to remember context and have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the second notebook, you'll give your agent long-term memory that persists across different sessions.
